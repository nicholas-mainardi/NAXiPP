// Notes: Although all the examples provided are configured to be built

//        provided in $(ANTLRSRC)/code/antlr/main/runtime/C/vs2005/rulefiles/antlr3.rules
//        there is no reason that this MUST be the case. Provided that you know how
//        to run the antlr tool, then just compile the resulting .c files and this
//	  file together, using say gcc or whatever: gcc *.c -I. -o XXX
//	  The C code is generic and will compile and run on all platforms (please
//        report any warnings or errors to the antlr-interest newsgroup (see www.antlr.org)
//        so that they may be corrected for any platofrm that I have not specifically tested.
//
//	  The project settings such as addinotal library paths and include paths have been set
//        relative to the place where this source code sits on the ANTLR perforce system. You
//        may well need to change the settings to locate the includes and the lib files. UNIX
//        people need -L path/to/antlr/libs -lantlr3c (release mode) or -lantlr3cd (debug)

// You may adopt your own practices by all means, but in general it is best
// to create a single include for your project, that will include the ANTLR3 C
// runtime header files, the generated header files (all of which are safe to include
// multiple times) and your own project related header files. Use <> to include and
// -I on the compile line (which vs2005 now handles, where vs2003 did not).

    // the only things you will ever explicitly free() as everythign else is created
    // via factories, that alloacte memory efficiently and free() everything they use
    // automatically when you close the parser/lexer/etc.

    // Note that this means only that the methods are always called via the object
    // pointer and the first argument to any method, is a pointer to the structure itself.
    // It also has the side advantage, if you are using an IDE such as VS2005 that can do it,
